                <h2>The First Problem</h2>
                <p> Recently, a big company in the US called the FCC, announced that they will basically just destroy the net neutrality laws.
                <br> Why is this a problem you ask? This is problem because your internet service providers will be able to slow down websites of their choice.
                <br>Let me give you an example.
                <br>
                <br>You are paying for your internet through the internet, one day a month. There's one day left until you have to pay, and you go to their website to pay. When you try to log in, it takes <strong>AGES</strong> to have the site load up. You have to go through multiple steps, which takes hours, and then, you miss your opportunity to pay. You get extra fees and so on.
                <br>
                <br><strong>This is not ok</strong>
                <br>
                <br>So you decide to change your ISP, so you'll go look around on the internet. You find another website to a new ISP and try to open the website. "Oh whoops, this site has been blocked". What do you do?</p>
