        <h2>The First Problem</h2>
            <p> Recently, a big company in the US called the FCC, announced that they will basically just destroy the net neutrality laws.
            <br> Why is this a problem you ask? This is problem because your internet service providers will be able to slow down websites of their choice.
            <br>Let me give you an example.
            <br>
            <br> For instance, like mentioned in the first problem, slowing down websites. They will make you pay more to have these websites return to the same download speed as any other website.
            <br> This is very frustating.
            <br><p>Everyone who is familiar with the internet and/or uses it regularly have experienced slow internet connection or just out right bad network speeds.

            <br> And the thing is, you can't do any legal thing about it without meeting your ISPs demands
            <br> (Which is most likely that you have to pay extra).
