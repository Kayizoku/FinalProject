        <h1>NET NEUTRAILITY</h1>
        <p>Would you like to pay extra fees for using common websites like Facebook or have someone constantly watching over you? Well... <strong>We dont.</strong></p> <!-- DÃ¥rlig tekst, skal byttes -->
                <h2>What is Net Neutrality?</h2>
                <p>
                    Net neutraility is basically internet's guiding principle. It preserves our right to communicate freely online.

                    <br>
                    Bascially, the internet as of now gives you the same download speed on every website you visit, you pay a set amount of money every month to get internet access and you dont have anyone monitoring every click you make on the world wide web (presumably). And now, someone wants to take it away from us.
