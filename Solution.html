				<h1>SOLUTION</h1>
				<p>To fight the FCC and protect net neutrality is not easy.<br><br> We can win if we stand together,<strong> and only then,</strong> we can overthorw the FCC and make their bill not pass through. But keep in mind, we don't have a lot of time left. In a matter of fact, there's only 3 weeks left.<br><br><strong>Your voice counts and it will be heard!</strong>
				So please, do your best to save net neutrality. The future of the internet as we know it is at stake.</p>

						<h2>The First Solution</h2>
						<p>The first and maybe the easiest thing you can do, is to submit a ticket to the FCC saying you want to restore internet freedom. They will read your ticket and take it to consideration with all the other tickets.</p>

						<p>The crucial thing here is not to harass someone in any way, that might lead to more negative outcomes than positive ones. Just state the facts and personal thoughts on why an open internet is important to you and should be accepted in todays society.</p>

						<div class="button"><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/proceedings?q=name:((17-108))" target="_blank">You can do this here</a> 
				</section>

				<section class="sol2">
					<h2>The Second Solution</h2>
					<p>The second thing you can do is to attend a local protest or host one of your own. You can find some below. </p>

						<div class="button"><a href="https://events.battleforthenet.com/#eventType=protestrally" target="_blank">Look for protests here</a>
					</div>
					<p>Protests are a great way of letting people know what's going on. Please, engage your friends and family members to participate in your protests too. Ask your neighbours, make a stand at the mall. Help people see the reality or this problem.</p>

						<h2>The Third Solution</h2>
						<p>Use social media, you know, the thing you use every day</p>

						<p>Spread the word through social media platforms. Use websites like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Blogposts, 4chan, Youtube... Anything.
						<br>Spending a few minutes to write a post or to make a snapchat story saying why we should protect and fight for net neutrality, makes people more aware and maybe more interested in the topic.
						<br>We need all the help we can get.
