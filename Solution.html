						<h2>The First Solution</h2>
						<p>The first and maybe the easiest thing you can do, is to submit a ticket to the FCC saying you want to restore internet freedom. They will read your ticket and take it to concideration with all the other tickets.</p>

						<p>The crucial thing here is not to harass someone in any way, that might lead to more negative outcomes than positive ones. Just state the facts and personal thoughts on why an open internet is important to you.</p>
