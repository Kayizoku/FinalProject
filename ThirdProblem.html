        <h2>The Third Problem</h2>
        <p>The third problem is that you will have very little control on what shows up on the web and what you do on the web.</p>

            <p>You will have people watching your every movement. That means you will have no privacy what so ever, and no option to be anonymous. <br>The scary thing here is that your ISP might be able to sell your private information like browsing histories and other things.</p>

            <p>Your ISP can also manipulate what will show up on different websites and they will monitor every thing you do. They have full control over how <strong>YOU</strong> use the internet. This means that the cable companies will no longer be obligated to deliver full internet access to everyone and every website.
