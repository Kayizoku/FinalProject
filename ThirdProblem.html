            <h2>The Third Problem</h2>
            <p>The third problem is that you will have very little control on what shows up on the web and what you do on the web.
                <br>
                <br> Your ISP can manipulate what will show up on different pages and they will monitor every thing you do. In other words, you have no privacy either.
