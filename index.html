        <h1>NET NEUTRAILITY</h1>
        <p>Would you like to pay extra fees for using common websites like facebook or have someone constantly watching over you? Well... <strong>We dont.</strong>
            <div class="intro">
                <h2>What is Net Neutrality?</h2>
                <p>
                    Neutraility is basically internet's guiding principle. It preserves our right to communicate freely online.
                    <br>
                    <br> For example: The internet as of now gives you the same download speed on every website you visit, you pay a set amount of money every month to get internet access and you dont have anyone monitoring every click you make on the world wide web (presumably). And now, someone wants to take it away from us.
                </p>
            </div>

    <div class="left">
        <h2>The First Problem</h2>
        <p> Recently, a big company in the US called the FCC, announced that they will basically just destroy the net neutrality laws.
            <br> Why is this a problem you ask?</ This is problem because your internet service providers will be able to slow down websites of their choice. <br>Let me give you an example.
            <br>
            <br>You are paying for your internet through the internet, one day a month. There's one day left until you have to pay, and you go to their website to pay. When you try to log in, it takes <strong>AGES</strong> to have the site load up. You have to go through multiple steps, which takes hours, and then, you miss your opportunity to pay. You get extra fees and so on.
            <br>
            <br><strong>This is not ok</strong>
            <br>
            <br>So you decide to change your ISP, so you'll go look around on the internet. You find another website to a new ISP and try to open the website. "Oh whoops, this site has been blocked". What do you do?
            <br>
            <br>This is of course one of many examples on why this is bad.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="right">
        <h2>The Second Problem</h2>
        <p>The second problem with no net neutrality is that your ISP can charge extra fees for using certain types websites of their choice.
            <br>
            <br> For instance, like mentioned in the first problem, slowing down websites. They will make you pay more to have these websites return to the same download speed as any other website.</p>
        <p>Everyone who is familiar with the internet and/or uses it regularly have experienced slow internet connection or just out right bad network speeds.
            <br> This is very frustating.
            <br>
            <br> And the thing is, you can't do any legal thing about it without meeting your ISPs demands
            <br> (Which is most likely that you have to pay extra).
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h2>The Third Problem</h2>
        <p>The third problem is that you will have very little control on what shows up on the web and what you do on the web.
            <br>
            <br> Your ISP can manipulate what will show up on different pages and they will monitor every thing you do. In other words, you have no privacy either.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>An example of this: North Korea.
            <br> Do we want our ISP to have the same power of our internet, as the North Korean government has over their media? <strong>No.</strong></p>
