    	   	<h1>What is Net Neutrality?</h1>
    	   	<p>

    	   	The internet should be fair to use in forms of 

    	   	Net Neutraility is basically internet's guiding principle. It preserves our right to communicate freely online.

  	        For example: The internet as of now gives you the same download speed on every website you visit, you pay a set amount of money every month to get internet access and you dont have anyone monitoring every click you make on the world wide web (presumably).<br><br>
            And now, someone wants to take it away from us.

    	   		<h2>The First Problem</h2>
    	   		<p>Recently, a big company in the US called the FCC, announced that they will basically just destroy the net neutrality laws.<br> Why is this a problem you ask?</p>

    	   		<p>This is problem because your internet service providers will be able to slow down websites of their choice. <br>Let me give you an example.<br><br>You are paying for your internet through the internet, one day a month. There's one day left until you have to pay, and you go to their website to pay. When you try to log in, it takes <strong>AGES</strong> to have the site load up. You have to go through multiple steps, which takes hours, and then, you miss your opportunity to pay. You get extra fees and so on.<br><br><strong>This is not ok</strong><br><br>So you decide to change your ISP, so you'll go look around on the internet. You find another website to a new ISP and try to open the website. "Oh whoops, this site has been blocked". What do you do?<br><br>This is ofcourse one of many examples on why this is bad.</p>

                <h2>The Second Problem</h2>
                <p>The second problem with no net neutrality is the your ISP can charge extra fees for you using a website.</p>
