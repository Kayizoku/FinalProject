        <h2>The Second Problem</h2>
        <p>The second problem with no net neutrality is that your ISP can charge extra fees for using certain types websites of their choice.
            <br>
            <br> For instance, like mentioned in the first problem, slowing down websites. They will make you pay more to have these websites return to the same download speed as any other website.</p>
        <p>Everyone who is familiar with the internet and/or uses it regularly have experienced slow internet connection or just out right bad network speeds.
            <br> This is very frustating.
            <br>
            <br> And the thing is, you can't do any legal thing about it without meeting your ISPs demands
            <br> (Which is most likely that you have to pay extra).
        </p>
