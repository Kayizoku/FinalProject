            <h2>The First Problem</h2>
                <p> Recently, a big company in the US called the FCC, announced that they will basically just destroy the net neutrality laws.
                <br> Why is this a problem you ask? This is problem because your internet service providers will be able to slow down websites of their choice.
                <br>Let me give you an example.
                <br>
                <br> For instance, like mentioned in the first problem, slowing down websites. They will make you pay more to have these websites return to the same download speed as any other website.
                <br> This is very frustating.
                <br><p>Everyone who is familiar with the internet and/or uses it regularly have experienced slow internet connection or just out right bad network speeds.

                <br> And the thing is, you can't do any legal thing about it without meeting your ISPs demands
                <br> (Which is most likely that you have to pay extra).
            </p>

    <section class="Second">
            <h2>The Second Problem</h2>
            <p>The second problem with no net neutrality is that your ISP can charge extra fees for using certain types websites of their choice.
                <br>
                <br> For instance, like mentioned in the first problem, slowing down websites. They will make you pay more to have these websites return to the same download speed as any other website.</p>
            <p>Everyone who is familiar with the internet and/or uses it regularly have experienced slow internet connection or just out right bad network speeds.

    <section class="Third">
            <h2>The Third Problem</h2>
            <p>The third problem is that you will have very little control on what shows up on the web and what you do on the web.
                <br>
                <br> Your ISP can manipulate what will show up on different pages and they will monitor every thing you do. In other words, you have no privacy either.
